                      </div>
                  <h6>Rodents’ biology and habits can make them challenging to control, and they present a serious menace to your home. If you’re in need of rodent control services, here’s what you should know about these pests:</h6>
                  <h6><strong>Rats:</strong> Rat are instinctively wary of things new to their environment, including rat control measures such as traps and bait, and colonize in attics, burrows, under concrete and porches, in wall voids and other hard-to-reach places. 
                    Rats can harbor and transmit a number of serious diseases. 
                    They can also introduce disease-carrying parasites such as fleas and ticks into your home.</h6>
                  <h6><strong>Mice:</strong> They invade your home seeking food, water and warmth. Each mouse can contaminate much more food than it eats.</h6>
                  <h6><strong>Rodent Family:</strong> The Order Rodentia is comprised of over 2,000 species, which are subdivided into many families. The Capromyidae, Castoridae, Cricetidae, Erethizontidae, Muridae, Sciuridae and Dipodidae are some of the most common families. 
                    The Family Muridae is the largest, containing nearly two-thirds of all rodent species. 
                    This family includes several subfamilies and includes sand rats, gerbils, crested rats and old world rats and mice. Rodents are warm-blooded mammals that, like humans, can be found throughout the world. 
                    They have oversized front teeth for gnawing and check teeth, which are adapted for chewing. 
                    Rodents chew on a variety of items available to them and cause great damage in and around homes.
                  <h6>Rodents tend to be rapid breeders. Some species breed year-round, and populations are maintained through constant reproduction. Because of the rodents’ body plan, they are capable of squeezing through spaces that appear to be much too small for them. 
                    All such holes should be sealed to prevent entry and reentry of rodents. A pest control professional should be contacted for assistance.
                    It is not advisable to handle any wild rodent. They are equipped with large teeth and are capable of transmitting a variety of bacteria, viruses and diseases through their saliva, feces and urine.
                    If you locate a rodent within your home, it is best to contact a pest management professional for removal and identification. The presence of one rodent within a home could signal an infestation. Keep all children and pets away from the rodent. If cornered, the rodent will bite to defend itself.

                                </div>
                            <h6>Mosquitoes belong to the same group as the true flies, Diptera. As such, they have a single pair of wings. 
                              They typically have long, thin legs and a head featuring a prominent proboscis</h6>
                            <h6>Mosquito bodies and wings most often are covered in tiny scales. Mosquitoes can be confused with flies.
                              Mosquitoes have long legs, and a long proboscis or “nose” that female mosquitoes use to “bite” people and pets to draw blood, needed to lay eggs.</h6>
                            <h6>Most flies won’t bite and even long-legged flies are usually much smaller than mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are pesky pests and can spread disease such as West Nile Virus, dengue and malaria.
                               More commonly, though, mosquitoes threaten family events more than health</h6>
                            <h6>Annoying signs of mosquito activity include the buzzing of the females and their bites. People have differing reactions to bites, ranging from mild irritation to intense inflammation and swelling.<br>
                              Signs of the immatures are their presence in standing water, which also can include watering dishes of containerized house plants.

                                      <h6>Ant enter through even the tiniest cracks, seeking water and sweet or greasy food substances in the kitchen pantry or storeroom areas. 
                                      <br>Ants leave an invisible chemical trail which contains pheromones for others to follow once they locate the food source.
                                          When flies feed on waste, they collect pathogens on their legs and mouths.</h6>
                                      <h6>These pathogens are then transferred to food on tables or counters when a fly lands again. Flies regurgitate on solid food then they eat the liquid.
                                      <br>They are capable of transmitting disease when they vomit, groom themselves or just walk on surfaces.</h6>

                                                    All termites consume cellulose-based plant materials. Unfortunately, all homes, regardless of their construction type, can provide cellulose food for termite infestation.</h6>

                                                    However, they can also be found in other parts of the home such as living rooms and closets.</h6>

                                          <h6>Cockroaches can wreak havoc on your home. The pest cockroaches can be carriers of various diseases because they are commonly found near waste deposits or in the kitchen, where food is present. 
                                              Restaurants may also experience cockroach infestations.</h6>
                                          <h6>Cockroaches emit unpleasant odors and may also produce sound. Cockroaches can enter your home in many different ways, from the outside through cracks and crevices, vents, sewer and drain pipes.
                                              We even bring them in on products like grocery bags, boxes, purses and on our person! Your home is an ideal breeding ground for certain pest species of cockroaches. With plenty of food, warmth, water and nesting sites, they can remain active all year round.</h6>
                                          <h6>It is worthy to note that they reproduce quickly. For every one you see there can be many, many more hiding and multiplying behind your walls.
                                              Because cockroaches typically are nocturnal, if you’ve seen one, you probably haven’t seen them all.<br>
                                              The few cockroaches you see by day could mean they were likely forced out by overcrowding; a possible sign of severe infestation.</h6>
                                          <h6>The debris created by cast-off cockroach skins, dead bodies and droppings can aggravate allergies, especially in children and sensitive individuals.</h6>
                                          <h6>Cockroaches are better at hiding than you are at finding them, and their eggs are naturally protected from many over-the-counter insecticides. Without special equipment,<br> 
                                              materials and know-how, cockroach control can be a losing battle.
